# KingSummon

**KingSummon** is a 2D top-down multiplayer game inspired by the childhood game "king-shwa". It has been converted into a mobile game to bring back the nostalgia and excitement. The game divides players into two teams: Runners and Chasers. The game takes place in an open rectangular field where players can roam freely within the boundaries.

### Game Description

#### Runner Team
1. **Starting Line and End Line**: Players start from a wide starting line which acts as their safe zone.
2. **Roles**: The team has one King (chosen by vote or randomly) and other members.
3. **Winning Condition**: The team wins if the King reaches the end line.
4. **King's Special Skill**: 
   - If other team members reach the end line, they merge with the King.
   - Merged members can detach (except the King), and the King can create new start points upon colliding with enemies.
5. **Losing Condition**: The team loses if the Runner King is killed.
6. **Elimination**: Runners can eliminate Chasers within the safe zone/starting line.
7. **Visibility**: Runners can see all enemy and ally locations on the minimap.
8. **Boundaries**: Once out of the safe zone, players cannot return.
9. **Temporary Skills**: Speed boosters and shields may appear randomly on the field.

#### Chaser Team
1. **Safe Zone**: The area between the starting line and end line is the Chasers' safe zone.
2. **Elimination**: Chasers can eliminate Runners who enter their safe zone.
3. **Winning Condition**: The team wins if the Runner King is killed.
4. **Losing Condition**: The team loses if the Runner King reaches the end line.
5. **King's Identity**: Chasers do not know who the Runner King is.
6. **Elimination Risk**: Chasers are eliminated if they enter the Runners' safe zone/starting line.
7. **Visibility**: Chasers cannot see the enemy location on the minimap unless Runners are out of the starting line.
8. **Temporary Skills**: Traps and path blockers may be earned by eliminating enemies.
